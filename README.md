# HuffmanEncoderDecoder

These are the end of assignment questions.

3. The theoretical entropy of the source text file is 4.531702948915945

4. The compressed entropy of the provided compressed file is 4.858789339677786

6. Suprisingly (to me), the compressed entropy of my encoded compressed file is 4.572940145254215

7. Looking at the evidence, it seems that my encoder achieves better compression than the original compressed file. The reason I say this
is because the compressed entropy of my encoded file is closer to the theoretical entropy of the source text file than the compressed 
entropy of the provided file


the order of files in data is compressed.dat -> uncompressed.txt -> compressedfromencoder.txt -> uncompressedtotestencoder
